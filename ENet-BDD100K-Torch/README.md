### Before Start

Please follow [list](./list) to put the BDD100K dataset (train, val, test) in the desired folder. The labels generated by our method are provided here ([train](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wjoOQT6OJlLETz0ZYThBWjSt1Tgzn6_j) and [val](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WaUjdgI4CMXkYFfi8Lz2rHiYYWLU5hav)). We'll call the directory that you cloned ENet-BDD100K-Torch as `$ENet_BDD100K_ROOT`. Note that this model only uses ENet as backbone, and if you use ENet-SAD, the performance will be better.

### Testing
1. Run test script
    ```Shell
    cd $ENet_BDD100K_ROOT
    sh ./experiments/test_ENet.sh
    ```
    By now, you should be able to reproduce the result (Accuracy: 0.3656, mIoU: 16.02).
    
### Training
1. Training ENet model
    ```Shell
    cd $ENet_BDD100K_ROOT
    sh ./experiments/train_ENet.sh
    ```
    The training process should start and trained models would be saved in `experiments/models/ENet-new/` by default.  
    Then you can test the trained model following the Testing steps above. If your model position or name is changed, remember to set them to yours accordingly.
